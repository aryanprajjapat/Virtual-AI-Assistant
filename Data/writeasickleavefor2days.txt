Here is a sample sick leave letter:

Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will be unable to come to work for the next two days, [Date] and [Date], as I am currently unwell and need to take some time to recover.

Unfortunately, I am experiencing [mention your illness or symptoms, e.g. fever, flu, stomach upset, etc.]. I am not feeling well enough to perform my duties and do not want to risk getting anyone else sick.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will do my best to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. If there are any pressing tasks that need my attention in the meantime, please let me know and I will do my best to complete them remotely.

Thank you for your understanding and I look forward to returning to work as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
Pradhan Jeweller
