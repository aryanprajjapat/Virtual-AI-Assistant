Aryan  : Jarvis can you tell a story in hindi?
Jarvis : Here's a short story in Hindi:
एक बार एक जंगल में एक छोटा सा लड़का रहता था। वह लड़का बहुत ही नेकदिल था और जंगल के सभी जानवरों से दोस्ती रखता था। एक दिन जंगल में एक भयानक आग लग गई। लड़के ने देखा कि सभी जानवर भाग रहे हैं, लेकिन एक बूढ़ी हिरनी पीछे रह गई थी। लड़के ने उस हिरनी को बचाया और जंगल से निकाल कर सुरक्षित स्थान पर पहुँचाया। हिरनी ने लड़के का शुक्रिया अदा किया और कहा कि मैं तुम्हें एक वरदान दूँगी। लड़के ने कहा कि मुझे कोई वरदान नहीं चाहिए, लेकिन हिरनी ने कहा कि मैं तुम्हें एक ऐसा वरदान दूँगी जिससे तुम कभी भी भूखा नहीं रहोगे। और फिर हिरनी ने लड़के को एक जादुई फल दिया जिसको खाने से लड़के को कभी भी भूखा नहीं लगा।
Translation: Once upon a time, there was a little boy living in a forest. He was very kind and friendly with all the animals in the forest. One day, a massive fire broke out in the forest. The boy saw that all the animals were running away, but an old deer was left behind. The boy saved the deer and took her to a safe place. The deer thanked the boy and said she would give him a blessing. The boy said he didn't want any blessing, but the deer insisted and gave him a magical fruit that would keep him from ever feeling hungry again.
